# JavaBasicsModule!

## Introduction
The idea of this project is to track a university classes, teachers and students, how to create a new class, a new student and how to add a student and teacher in a class, you can see the list of students and teachers, and finally, search in which classes are one student.

## Architecture

The first version of our class diagram is the version that you can see, but, the final version change a bit, I consider inserting an interface that control all services that the university use, like add a student to a new class, the main idea is approach the polymorphism in java.
